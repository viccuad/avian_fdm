///
/// Add this component to the aircraft root entity when the zone layout is too
/// sparse to produce realistic physical damping from geometry alone (e.g. a
/// single-zone missile body, or a low-fidelity AI aircraft).
///
/// **Mutually exclusive with per-zone local α/β**, when this component is
/// present, [`compute_aero_forces`](crate::aerodynamics::compute_aero_forces)
/// evaluates all zones at the global α/β (no rate corrections) and uses these
/// derivatives as the sole source of angular damping.  When absent, per-zone
/// local angles run and damping emerges naturally from zone geometry.
///
/// # Non-dimensional form
///
/// **Damping moment = damping derivative × normalised angular rate × dynamic
/// pressure × wing area × reference length. The normalised rate (e.g. roll rate
/// × wingspan ÷ 2 × airspeed) is dimensionless, it compares rotational tip
/// speed to forward speed. Negative derivatives mean damping opposes motion.**
