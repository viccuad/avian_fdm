//! # avian_fdm — 6-DoF Flight Dynamics Model for Bevy + Avian
//!
//! `avian_fdm` is a Bevy plugin that turns an Avian rigid-body hierarchy into
//! a physically plausible aircraft. Each physics step it evaluates
//! aerodynamic and propulsive forces on every [`components::AeroZone`] child
//! entity and accumulates them into Avian's [`avian3d::prelude::ConstantForce`]
//! and [`avian3d::prelude::ConstantTorque`] on the root body. Avian's
//! integrator then advances position, velocity, orientation, and angular
//! velocity — `avian_fdm` never touches those directly.
//!
//! Mass, centre of gravity, and the full inertia tensor are computed
//! automatically by Avian from the [`avian3d::prelude::ColliderDensity`] on
//! each child collider. Damaging or destroying a zone (setting
//! [`components::Damageable::health`] to 0) instantly updates the physics
//! without any bookkeeping on the game's part.

//!
//! ## Quick Start
//!
//! Add `avian_fdm` and `avian3d` to `Cargo.toml`:
//!
//! ```toml
//! avian_fdm = { version = "0.1", features = ["presets"] }
//! avian3d   = { version = "0.6" }
//! bevy      = { version = "0.18" }
//! ```
//!
//! Spawn the reference J-3 Cub aircraft:
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use avian_fdm::prelude::*;
//! use avian_fdm::presets::j3cub;
//! use avian3d::prelude::{LinearVelocity, PhysicsPlugins};
//! use bevy::prelude::*;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     App::new()
//!         .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)
//!         .add_plugins(PhysicsPlugins::default())
//!         .add_plugins(AircraftFdmPlugin)
//!         .add_systems(Startup, spawn)
//!         .run();
//! }
//!
//! fn spawn(mut commands: Commands) {
//!     let root = j3cub::spawn(
//!         &mut commands,
//!         Transform::from_xyz(0.0, 300.0, 0.0)
//!             .with_rotation(Quat::from_rotation_x(std::f32::consts::FRAC_PI_2)),
//!     );
//!     // Give it cruise airspeed so it doesn't fall before lift builds up.
//!     commands.entity(root).insert(LinearVelocity(Vec3::new(27.0, 0.0, 0.0)));
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Build your own aircraft by assembling [`components::AeroZone`] children
//! around an [`components::AircraftCoreBundle`] root (see
//! [Zone Decomposition](#zone-decomposition-and-damage)).
//!
//! ---
//!
//! ## What is a Flight Dynamics Model?
//!
//! A **Flight Dynamics Model** (FDM) is the mathematical subsystem that
//! computes all forces and moments acting on an aircraft at each instant, given
//! its current state (position, velocity, attitude, angular rate) and the
//! pilot's control inputs.
//!
//! The output of an FDM feeds Newton's laws: the rigid-body integrator advances
//! the state forward in time. `avian_fdm` is the FDM; [Avian] is the
//! integrator.
//!
//! ### Scope of this library
//!
//! | In scope | Out of scope |
//! |----------|-------------|
//! | ISA atmosphere (0–20 km) | Ground contact / landing gear forces |
//! | Lift, drag, side-force per zone | Structural elasticity / aeroelasticity |
//! | Pitch/roll/yaw damping derivatives | Compressibility (transonic/supersonic) |
//! | Piston engine + fixed-pitch propeller | Turbine / jet engine cycles |
//! | Damage degradation and detachment | Fuel burn / weight change over time |
//! | 6-DoF integration (via Avian) | Autopilot / stability augmentation |
//!
//! ### Stability-derivative approach
//!
//! `avian_fdm` uses the **small-perturbation stability-derivative method**
//! (sometimes called the *linear aerodynamic model*). Aerodynamic coefficients
//! — C_L, C_D, C_Y — are expressed as tabulated functions of angle of attack α
//! and Reynolds number Re, then multiplied by dynamic pressure q̄ and
//! reference area S:
//!
//! ```text
//! Lift  = C_L(α, Re) · q̄ · S
//! Drag  = C_D(α, Re) · q̄ · S
//! Side  = C_Y(α, Re) · q̄ · S
//! ```
//!
//! This is the same method used by [JSBSim], [FlightGear], and most
//! fixed-wing game simulators. It captures realistic stall behaviour,
//! Reynolds-number effects, and control-surface authority without requiring a
//! full CFD solver.
//!
//! ---
//!
//! ## Coordinate Frames
//!
//! Two frames appear throughout the codebase. Understanding both is essential
//! when reading zone transforms or force vectors.
//!
//! ### Body frame (SAE aerospace convention)
//!
//! ```text
//!         X ──► (forward / nose)
//!        ╱
//!       ╱
//!      ╱──── Y (right wing / starboard)
//!      │
//!      ▼  Z (down / belly)
//! ```
//!
//! | Axis | Points toward | Positive rotation (right-hand rule) |
//! |------|---------------|--------------------------------------|
//! | X    | Nose          | Roll right (starboard wing down)     |
//! | Y    | Right wing    | Pitch nose up                        |
//! | Z    | Belly / down  | Yaw nose right                       |
//!
//! This matches the SAE J670 standard used in JSBSim and most aerospace
//! textbooks (Stevens & Lewis, Etkin & Reid, Nelson).
//!
//! Zone transforms in the presets are authored in this frame. Example:
//! a wing zone at `Transform::from_xyz(-0.10, -2.82, -0.58)` is 0.10 m aft of
//! the CG datum, 2.82 m to port (−Y), and 0.58 m above datum (−Z = up).
//!
//! ### Stability frame
//!
//! The stability frame is the body frame rotated by −α about body Y, aligning
//! its X axis with the velocity vector. Lift is defined as perpendicular to the
//! velocity (−Z_stability), drag as opposing it (−X_stability):
//!
//! ```text
//! force_stability = (−C_D·q̄·S,  C_Y·q̄·S,  −C_L·q̄·S)
//! force_body      = R_y(−α) · force_stability
//! force_world     = q_root  · force_body
//! ```
//!
//! See [`aerodynamics`] for the full derivation.
//!
//! ### World frame (Bevy / Avian, Y-up right-handed)
//!
//! Bevy uses a Y-up, right-handed world frame. The aircraft must be spawned
//! with a rotation that aligns body X (forward) → world X and body Z (down) →
//! world −Y. `Quat::from_rotation_x(FRAC_PI_2)` achieves this.
//!
//! All internal computation uses `f64` for numerical stability. The only
//! `f64 → f32` cast is when writing to Avian's `f32` force/torque components.
//!
//! ---
//!
//! ## The Equations of Motion
//!
//! An aircraft in free flight has **6 degrees of freedom** (6-DoF): three
//! translational (x, y, z) and three rotational (roll φ, pitch θ, yaw ψ).
//! Avian integrates all six, so this section explains what Avian is solving and
//! what `avian_fdm` must supply.
//!
//! ### Translational dynamics
//!
//! Newton's second law in vector form:
//!
//! ```text
//! F_net = m · (dV/dt)
//! ```
//!
//! where **V** is the centre-of-mass velocity in world coordinates. `avian_fdm`
//! supplies **F_net** via [`avian3d::prelude::ConstantForce`]; Avian advances
//! **V** each substep.
//!
//! The forces that `avian_fdm` contributes are:
//! - Aerodynamic: lift, drag, side-force from each [`components::AeroZone`]
//! - Propulsive: thrust from each [`components::EngineZone`]
//!
//! Gravity is applied separately by Avian's own gravity system.
//!
//! ### Rotational dynamics (Euler's equations)
//!
//! In **body frame**, with principal axes close to body X/Y/Z, Euler's
//! equations of motion are:
//!
//! ```text
//! L = I_xx · ṗ + (I_zz − I_yy) · q · r   (roll  equation)
//! M = I_yy · q̇ + (I_xx − I_zz) · p · r   (pitch equation)
//! N = I_zz · ṙ + (I_yy − I_xx) · p · q   (yaw   equation)
//! ```
//!
//! where (p, q, r) are body-frame roll/pitch/yaw rates, and (L, M, N) are the
//! roll/pitch/yaw moments. Avian evaluates this system internally; `avian_fdm`
//! supplies (L, M, N) via [`avian3d::prelude::ConstantTorque`] by computing the
//! cross product of each zone force with its moment arm:
//!
//! ```text
//! τ_zone = (r_zone − r_CG) × F_zone
//! ```
//!
//! where **r_zone** is the zone's world position and **r_CG** is the
//! world-space centre of mass (read from
//! [`avian3d::prelude::ComputedCenterOfMass`]).
//!
//! ### Why Avian handles integration
//!
//! Implementing a numerically stable 6-DoF integrator is non-trivial — it
//! requires careful handling of quaternion renormalisation, sub-stepping for
//! stiff systems, and correct coupling between translation and rotation.
//! Avian provides all of this, tested and optimised. `avian_fdm` stays in its
//! lane: force and moment computation only.
//!
//! ---
//!
//! ## The Atmosphere
//!
//! See [`atmosphere`] for the full implementation.
//!
//! ### Why density drives everything
//!
//! Every aerodynamic force scales with **dynamic pressure**:
//!
//! ```text
//! q̄ = ½ · ρ · V²
//! ```
//!
//! where ρ is air density (kg/m³) and V is true airspeed (m/s). At sea level
//! ρ₀ = 1.225 kg/m³; at 2 500 m it drops to roughly 0.98 kg/m³ — a 20%
//! reduction that directly cuts lift and drag by 20% at the same airspeed.
//! An aircraft must fly faster at altitude to generate the same lift.
//!
//! Dynamic pressure also controls Reynolds number:
//!
//! ```text
//! Re = ρ · V · c̄ / μ
//! ```
//!
//! where c̄ is mean aerodynamic chord and μ is dynamic viscosity. Reynolds
//! number governs boundary-layer behaviour: at low Re the flow separates
//! earlier (sharper stall, higher C_D₀), so the FDM uses Re as the second
//! dimension of its C_L/C_D lookup tables.
//!
//! ### International Standard Atmosphere (ISA)
//!
//! The [`atmosphere`] module implements ICAO Doc 7488 for 0–20 km:
//!
//! **Troposphere (h ≤ 11 000 m):**
//! ```text
//! T = 288.15 − 0.0065 · h          (K)
//! p = 101 325 · (T / 288.15)^5.256 (Pa)
//! ρ = p / (287.053 · T)             (kg/m³)
//! ```
//!
//! **Stratosphere (11 000 m < h ≤ 20 000 m):**
//! ```text
//! T = 216.65                                     (K, isothermal)
//! p = p₁₁ · exp(−g · (h − 11000) / (R · T₁₁))  (Pa)
//! ρ = p / (R · T)                                (kg/m³)
//! ```
//!
//! Dynamic viscosity μ uses **Sutherland's law** — the gas-kinetic model that
//! correctly predicts viscosity *increasing* with temperature (opposite to
//! liquids):
//!
//! ```text
//! μ = 1.716×10⁻⁵ · (T/273.15)^(3/2) · (273.15 + 110.4) / (T + 110.4)
//! ```
//!
//! Every frame, [`atmosphere::update_atmosphere`] writes a fresh
//! [`components::AtmosphereState`] to the root entity; the aerodynamics and
//! propulsion systems read from it.
//!
//! ---
//!
//! ## Aerodynamic Forces and Moments
//!
//! See [`aerodynamics`] for the full implementation.
//!
//! ### Stability derivatives — a Taylor series in disguise
//!
//! Aerodynamic coefficients are measured quantities, not derived from first
//! principles in real-time. The stability-derivative method represents them as
//! a **Taylor series** around a trim condition (small perturbations):
//!
//! ```text
//! C_L(α) ≈ C_L₀ + C_Lα · α + C_Lα² · α² + …
//! C_D(α) ≈ C_D₀ + k · C_L²        (parabolic drag polar)
//! ```
//!
//! For large-α behaviour (stall, post-stall), a lookup table is more accurate
//! than a truncated series. `avian_fdm` uses [`components::aero_coeff::AeroCoeff`],
//! which supports three representations:
//!
//! | Variant | Use case |
//! |---------|----------|
//! | `Scalar(f64)` | Constant coefficient (e.g. fuselage parasitic drag) |
//! | `Table1D` | C_L(α) for simple surfaces |
//! | `Table2D` | C_L(α, Re) for wings where boundary-layer state matters |
//!
//! The J3Cub preset uses `Table2D` for wing C_L and C_D, with α breakpoints
//! from −20° to +20° and two Re columns (1.7 × 10⁶ and 3.7 × 10⁶) derived
//! from JSBSim's J3Cub.xml and USA-35B airfoil measurements.
//!
//! ### Force construction pipeline
//!
//! For each [`components::AeroZone`] child:
//!
//! 1. Read α, q̄, Re from [`components::FlightState`] on the root entity.
//! 2. Evaluate C_L(α, Re), C_D(α, Re), C_Y(α, Re) via bilinear interpolation.
//! 3. Multiply by the zone's share of reference area (`fraction × S_ref`).
//! 4. Scale by zone health ∈ [0, 1] — zero-health zones contribute nothing.
//! 5. Construct the force vector in **stability axes**:
//!    ```text
//!    F_stab = (−C_D·q̄·S,  C_Y·q̄·S,  −C_L·q̄·S)
//!    ```
//! 6. Rotate to world: `F_world = q_root · R_y(−α) · F_stab`
//! 7. Write to [`components::ZoneForce`] on the zone entity.
//!
//! All of this happens in [`aerodynamics::compute_aero_forces`], which also
//! evaluates per-zone pure torques from CM/Croll/Cn coefficients and sums
//! everything into [`avian3d::prelude::ConstantForce`] /
//! [`avian3d::prelude::ConstantTorque`] on the root.
//!
//! ### Dynamic damping
//!
//! Angular-rate damping is applied once per root as whole-aircraft moment
//! increments (not per zone). The three damping derivatives are from
//! Nelson (1998), Table B1, for the J3Cub:
//!
//! ```text
//! ΔM = C_Mq · (q·c̄/2V) · q̄·S·c̄   (pitch damping,  C_Mq = −12)
//! ΔL = C_lp · (p·b/2V) · q̄·S·b    (roll  damping,  C_lp = −0.45)
//! ΔN = C_nr · (r·b/2V) · q̄·S·b    (yaw   damping,  C_nr = −0.12)
//! ```
//!
//! These provide the rate-dependent restoring moments that prevent unrealistic
//! divergent oscillations. Without pitch damping, for example, a phugoid
//! perturbation would not decay.
//!
//! ### Control surfaces
//!
//! Each zone can be tagged with a [`components::ControlSurfaceRole`]:
//!
//! | Role | Input read | Effect |
//! |------|-----------|--------|
//! | `Elevator` | `ControlInputs::elevator` | Scales zone C_L linearly |
//! | `AileronLeft` | `ControlInputs::aileron` | C_L scaled +aileron |
//! | `AileronRight` | `ControlInputs::aileron` | C_L scaled −aileron |
//! | `Rudder` | `ControlInputs::rudder` | Scales zone C_Y linearly |
//!
//! Deflection also increases drag slightly (C_D scaled by `|input|`).
//! The moment arm from zone position to CG generates roll/pitch/yaw moments
//! automatically — no separate moment coefficient needed.
//!
//! ---
//!
//! ## Propulsion Coupling
//!
//! *Only compiled with `features = ["propulsion"]`.* See [`propulsion`].
//!
//! ### Piston engine model
//!
//! Thrust at altitude follows the **Gagg-Ferrar correction**:
//!
//! ```text
//! T = T_max · η_throttle · (ρ/ρ₀)^0.7
//! ```
//!
//! where `η_throttle` is read from a configurable thrust-fraction lookup table
//! (allowing non-linear throttle response curves). The density exponent 0.7 is
//! empirically validated for naturally-aspirated piston engines.
//!
//! ### Actuator disk — propwash velocity
//!
//! The induced velocity behind the propeller (used later for propwash coupling)
//! is estimated with **actuator disk theory**:
//!
//! ```text
//! V_ind = √(T / (2 · ρ · A_disk))    A_disk = π · (d/2)²
//! ```
//!
//! This is stored in [`components::PropwashState`] on the root entity. Future
//! work (Group B, v2) will use V_ind to augment the lift of zones in the
//! propwash stream (elevator and horizontal stabiliser on a tractor aircraft).
//!
//! ### Thrust axis
//!
//! Each [`components::EngineZone`] specifies `thrust_axis_body: DVec3`, the
//! thrust direction in body frame. For a normal tractor aircraft this is
//! `DVec3::X` (forward); for a pusher or a tilted engine it can point elsewhere.
//! The body-frame axis is rotated to world space by the root quaternion before
//! writing to [`components::ZoneForce`].
//!
//! ---
//!
//! ## Zone Decomposition and Damage
//!
//! ### Decomposing an aircraft into zones
//!
//! The key design insight: **each structural part of the aircraft is a separate
//! ECS entity** (an [`components::AeroZone`]) child of the root rigid body.
//! Each zone owns:
//! - A [`avian3d::prelude::Collider`] that gives it physical volume and mass
//!   (via [`avian3d::prelude::ColliderDensity`])
//! - A [`avian3d::prelude::Transform`] that places it in body-frame coordinates
//! - An [`components::AeroZone`] that describes its aerodynamic contribution
//! - Optionally a [`components::Damageable`] for health tracking
//!
//! Avian **automatically** computes total mass, CG, and inertia tensor from
//! all child colliders. No explicit bookkeeping required.
//!
//! **Typical zone layout:**
//!
//! | Zone | Aerodynamic role | Dominant coefficients |
//! |------|------------------|-----------------------|
//! | Wing panels (×6) | Lift + roll | C_L(α, Re) table |
//! | Ailerons (×2) | Roll control | C_L scaled by aileron input |
//! | Fuselage | Parasitic drag | C_D only |
//! | H-stabiliser | Pitch stability | C_L(α) restorative |
//! | Elevator | Pitch control | C_L scaled by elevator input |
//! | V-tail | Yaw stability (mass placeholder) | C_Y = 0 until v2 |
//! | Rudder | Yaw control | C_Y scaled by rudder input |
//! | Engine zone | Thrust + mass | — |
//!
//! ### How zone contributions compose
//!
//! Total lift = Σ C_L_zone · q̄ · S_zone (summed over all non-zero-health zones)
//!
//! Each zone's `fraction` field controls its share of the reference area S_ref.
//! For the J3Cub wing, six panels each take 15–17.5% of total wing area; they
//! sum to 100%. The fuselage and tail zones have their own `wing_area_m2` (via
//! the root [`components::AircraftGeometry`]) so their coefficients scale correctly.
//!
//! ### Health degradation
//!
//! When [`components::Damageable::health`] is set to a value ∈ (0, 1):
//!
//! ```text
//! C_L_effective = C_L · health
//! C_D_effective = C_D · health + C_D_damage · (1 − health) / q̄
//! ```
//!
//! A damaged wing produces less lift AND more drag (deformation increases
//! induced drag). At `health = 0`, the zone contributes zero force — it has
//! effectively stalled/separated and produces no net aerodynamic effect.
//!
//! ### Physical detachment (`DetachPlugin`)
//!
//! *Only compiled with `features = ["damage"]`.* See [`detach`].
//!
//! When health reaches exactly 0.0, [`detach::DetachPlugin`] (if registered)
//! removes the zone from the aircraft hierarchy and inserts
//! [`avian3d::prelude::RigidBody::Dynamic`] onto it, giving it independent
//! physics. The piece inherits the aircraft's current linear and angular
//! velocity, so it flies off with realistic momentum.
//!
//! Avian **automatically recomputes** the aircraft's mass, CG, and inertia
//! tensor after detachment — a wing detaching shifts the CG and changes roll/
//! yaw inertia without any manual update.
//!
//! Games that want debris-free damage (zones simply stop contributing without
//! flying away) can omit `DetachPlugin`; zero-health zones already produce no
//! force by default.
//!
//! ---
//!
//! ## Reading Simulation Output
//!
//! [`components::FlightState`] is updated every physics frame on the root entity.
//! Use it in systems or for HUD display:
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! # use avian_fdm::prelude::*;
//! # use bevy::prelude::*;
//! fn print_flight_state(query: Query<&FlightState, With<AircraftGeometry>>) {
//!     for fs in &query {
//!         println!(
//!             "alt={:.0}m  TAS={:.1}m/s  AoA={:.2}°  Re={:.2e}",
//!             fs.altitude_m,
//!             fs.airspeed_ms,
//!             fs.alpha_rad.to_degrees(),
//!             fs.reynolds_number,
//!         );
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! | Field | Units | Notes |
//! |-------|-------|-------|
//! | `altitude_m` | m | World Y position (positive up) |
//! | `airspeed_ms` | m/s | True airspeed (TAS) = body-frame velocity magnitude |
//! | `alpha_rad` | rad | Angle of attack; positive = nose above velocity vector |
//! | `beta_rad` | rad | Sideslip angle; positive = wind from starboard |
//! | `dynamic_pressure_pa` | Pa | q̄ = ½ρV² |
//! | `reynolds_number` | — | Re = ρVc̄/μ; drives C_L/C_D table column |
//! | `mach` | — | V / speed of sound; informational (no compressibility yet) |
//! | `p_rads`, `q_rads`, `r_rads` | rad/s | Body-frame roll/pitch/yaw rates |
//!
//! **Interpreting trim quality:**
//! - Level cruise: `alpha_rad` ≈ 2–5° (positive, small), `airspeed_ms` stable
//! - Phugoid: `airspeed_ms` and `alpha_rad` oscillate slowly (period ≈ 2πV/g);
//!   this is a natural mode and indicates the pitch model is working
//! - Divergence: `alpha_rad` grows unbounded → check elevator C_L sign
//!   convention and h-stab moment arm
//!
//! ---
//!
//! ## Data Flow
//!
//! All FDM systems run in `PhysicsStepSystems::BroadPhase` — after Avian's
//! child-collider position propagation (First), but before the constraint
//! solver. Forces are written to `ConstantForce`/`ConstantTorque` and read by
//! Avian's `ForceSystems::ApplyConstantForces` in the Solver phase.

//!
//! ### Inserting a custom system (e.g. autopilot)
//!
//! Place it between `update_flight_state` and `compute_aero_forces`:
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! # use bevy::prelude::*;
//! # use avian3d::prelude::{PhysicsSchedule, PhysicsStepSystems};
//! # use avian_fdm::prelude::*;
//! # use avian_fdm::atmosphere::update_flight_state;
//! # use avian_fdm::aerodynamics::compute_aero_forces;
//! # fn my_autopilot() {}
//! // app.add_systems(
//! //     PhysicsSchedule,
//! //     my_autopilot
//! //         .after(update_flight_state)
//! //         .before(compute_aero_forces)
//! //         .in_set(PhysicsStepSystems::BroadPhase),
//! // );
//! ```
//!
//! The autopilot reads [`components::FlightState`] and writes
//! [`components::ControlInputs`]; both are available at that point in the chain.
//!
//! ---
//!
//! ## Feature Flags
//!
//! | Feature      | Default | Description |
//! |--------------|---------|-------------|
//! | `damage`     | **on**  | [`components::Damageable`] component and [`detach::DetachPlugin`] |
//! | `propulsion` | **on**  | Piston engine ([`components::EngineZone`]) and propwash model |
//! | `debug-viz`  | off     | Bevy Gizmo overlays + egui HUD via [`debug`] |
//! | `presets`    | off     | Reference aircraft presets ([`presets`], e.g. J-3 Cub) |
//!
//! The `damage` and `propulsion` features are on by default because most
//! flight simulators need both. Disable with `default-features = false` if your
//! aircraft is immortal and un-powered (e.g. a glider with fixed health).
//!
//! ---
//!
//! ## Further Reading
//!
//! The following references were used in designing and validating `avian_fdm`.
//! They are listed roughly in order of accessibility.
//!
//! ### Introductory
//!
//! - **Robert C. Nelson, *Flight Stability and Automatic Control*, 2nd ed.
//!   (McGraw-Hill, 1998).**
//!   The clearest introduction to the stability-derivative approach. Table B1
//!   lists J3Cub-like GA derivatives used for the damping coefficients in
//!   [`aerodynamics`]. Chapters 2–4 cover the EoM derivation in body frame.
//!
//! - **John D. Anderson, *Introduction to Flight*, 8th ed. (McGraw-Hill, 2015).**
//!   Excellent coverage of aerodynamics fundamentals (lift, drag, Reynolds
//!   number, boundary layers) before tackling dynamics. Chapters 5 and 7 are
//!   especially relevant.
//!
//! ### Intermediate
//!
//! - **Bernard Etkin & Lloyd D. Reid, *Dynamics of Flight: Stability and
//!   Control*, 3rd ed. (Wiley, 1996).**
//!   Rigorous derivation of the 6-DoF Newton-Euler equations in body frame.
//!   The stability axis transformation (body → stability → wind axes) used in
//!   [`aerodynamics`] follows Etkin & Reid Chapter 4.
//!
//! - **Brian L. Stevens, Frank L. Lewis & Eric N. Johnson,
//!   *Aircraft Simulation and Control*, 3rd ed. (Wiley, 2016).**
//!   The standard reference for simulation architecture. The coordinate frame
//!   conventions in this library match Stevens & Lewis Appendix A. Also covers
//!   numerical integration and digital flight control systems.
//!
//! ### Atmospheric model
//!
//! - **ICAO Doc 7488/3, *Manual of the ICAO Standard Atmosphere*, 3rd ed.
//!   (International Civil Aviation Organization, 1993).**
//!   The authoritative definition of the International Standard Atmosphere
//!   implemented in [`atmosphere`]. Free download from the ICAO store.
//!
//! ### Open-source simulators
//!
//! - **[JSBSim](https://github.com/JSBSim-Team/jsbsim)** — Mature open-source
//!   FDM used by FlightGear and the US military. The J3Cub aerodynamic tables
//!   in [`presets::j3cub`] are derived from JSBSim's `J3Cub.xml` and cross-
//!   checked against USA-35B airfoil data. JSBSim's documentation explains the
//!   stability-derivative XML format in detail.
//!
//! - **[FlightGear](https://www.flightgear.org/)** — Open-source flight
//!   simulator using JSBSim as its default FDM. Useful for cross-validating
//!   flight behaviour and visualising aerodynamic data.
//!
//! - **[OpenPilot / ArduPilot](https://ardupilot.org/)** — Real autopilot
//!   firmware with extensive FDM documentation. Relevant if adding a stability-
//!   augmentation system on top of `avian_fdm`.
